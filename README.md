# Employee CRUD Operations using Kotlin, Ktor, and Koin

This project demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations for managing employee data using Kotlin programming language with Ktor framework for building HTTP servers and Koin framework for dependency injection.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

  - **src/main/kotlin/com/api/rest/ktor/** : Contains the main Kotlin source code.
  - **src/main/kotlin/com/api/rest/ktor/routes/** : Contains controller classes responsible for handling HTTP requests.
  - **src/main/kotlin/com/api/rest/ktor/services/** : Contains service classes responsible for business logic.
  - **src/main/kotlin/com/api/rest/ktor/models/** : Contains data classes representing the Employee entity.
  - **src/main/kotlin/com/api/rest/ktor/di/** : Contains Koin modules for dependency injection configuration.
- **src/test/kotlin/** : Contains unit and integration tests for the application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Kotlin
- Ktor
- Koin
- JDK
- Gradle

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd employee-crud-kotlin-ktor-koin
```

3. Build the project:

```
gradle build
```

4. Run the application:

```
gradle run
```

By default, the application will start on port 8080.

## Endpoints

The application exposes the following endpoints:

- **GET /employees**: Fetches all employees.
- **GET /employees/{id}**: Fetches details of a specific employee by ID.
- **POST /employees**: Creates a new employee.
- **DELETE /employees/{id}**: Deletes a specific employee by ID.

## Configuration

You can configure the application settings such as database connection details, server port, etc., in the `application.conf` file located in the `resources` directory.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- Ktor: Web framework for building asynchronous servers and clients.
- Koin: Dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- netty: Lightweight in-memory server for running kotlin or SpringBoot application.

## Testing

The application includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness of business logic and API endpoints. You can run the tests using the following command:

```
gradle test
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for any improvements or fixes.
